Just simple Project Euler solutions from projecteuler.net

Problems are sorted much like a stem and leaf plot, with folders for ones digits
contianed in folders for tens digits, etc.

Each folder then has folders for each language I've solved the problem with (usually trivial reworkings to learn new languages)
